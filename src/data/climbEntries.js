That's it. Purely remote businesses — agencies that only ever meet clients on Zoom, online stores with no pickup, software companies — do not qualify, full stop.

For the public service area, add the actual suburbs or cities you serve — for us that's Melbourne and the surrounding metro suburbs, not every postcode in Victoria. Google is smart enough to surface you for nearby searches inside your stated area, and over-listing looks like spam. The honest, narrow answer outranks the greedy one almost every time.

Don't write the review for them. Don't offer a discount in exchange. Don't post a flood of reviews in the same week — that's the single most common pattern Google flags as fake.

Don't stuff keywords into your business name field ("Onrai Studio Melbourne Web Design SEO") — Google's guidelines call it out by name and will strip the profile or suspend it. Don't buy reviews, don't trade reviews with other businesses, and don't ask staff or family to review you. The whole chapter has been about surfacing what's true.
